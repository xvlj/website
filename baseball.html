        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The position of umpiring can be a strenuous one: an average game
          consists of over 120 pitches, requiring the umpire to ‘call’ whether
          the pitches are balls or strikes. This project is an attempt to
          predict the performance of umpires using 3 different datasets. Pitch
          tracking technology known as PITCHf/x provide locations of pitches and
          other statistics from each pitch are collected. On average, umpires
          miss about 10 percent of calls.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project reports on the call precision of a particular umpire
          through the use of Bayesian logistic models. Various models were
          generated to compare these attributes over three separate umpires.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="data">
        <h2>Data Description</h2>
        <p>
          The data from the PITCHf/x software was provided through spreadsheets
          of various pitch reports spanning from 2018-2022. Each record contains
          92 different features, ranging from various player statistics to the x
          and z-axis position coordinates of the ball.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initial data sets required evaluation to develop meaningful variables
          for feature selection. For instance, a variable was developed to
          indicate an umpire's incorrect call based on pitch locations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          Determining important features for the models was challenging due to
          the number of variables in the datasets. Initially, models of
          intuitive features like pitch velocities and spin rates were created
          but did not perform well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Model performance was ultimately improved by introducing manually
          calculated variables. These variables, known as 'x_dis' and 'z_dis',
          calculate the distance to the nearest strikezone in the x and z
          direction. This metric is one of the best for predicting umpire
          performance as seen by the model comparison.
        </p>

        <h2>Models and Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          Various Bayesian logistic models were developed and compared to
          determine the best predictors of umpire call precision. Below are some
          of the models and their evaluations:
        </p>

        <h3>Model A: 'plate_x', 'plate_z'</h3>
        <p>
          This baseline model predicts umpire ability based solely on pitch
          location.
        </p>
        <img src="images/model_a_coefficients.png" alt="Model A Coefficients" />

        <h3>Model B: 'plate_x', 'plate_z', 'delta_run_exp'</h3>
        <p>
          This model introduces 'delta_run_exp' which indicates the change in
          run expectancy.
        </p>
        <img src="images/model_b_coefficients.png" alt="Model B Coefficients" />

        <h3>Model C: 'x_dis', 'z_dis'</h3>
        <p>
          This model uses manually calculated distances to the nearest strike
          zone boundaries.
        </p>
        <img src="images/model_c_coefficients.png" alt="Model C Coefficients" />

        <h3>Model D: 'x_dis', 'z_dis', 'delta_run_exp'</h3>
        <p>This model combines the distance metrics with 'delta_run_exp'.</p>
        <img src="images/model_d_coefficients.png" alt="Model D Coefficients" />

        <h3>Model E: 'x_dis', 'z_dis', 'pitcher_walkRate'</h3>
        <p>
          This model includes the pitcher's walk rate as an additional
          predictor.
        </p>

      <section id="results">
        <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
        <p>
          Model D performed the best across all umpire data sets, indicating
          that 'x_dis', 'z_dis', and 'delta_run_exp' are the most effective
          predictors of umpire accuracy. The table ranking of models can be seen
          below using LOOCV:
        </p>
        <img src="images/model_comparison_table.png" alt="Model Comparison" />
        <p>
          LOOCV is a type of cross-validation method in which a single data
          point is removed from the dataset, and the model is trained on the
          remaining data points. The removed data point is then used as a test
          case to evaluate the model's performance. A visual comparison of this
          table can be seen below.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The Bayesian logistic modeling approach effectively identified key
          predictors of umpire call precision. The best predictors were found to
          be the distances from pitch location to strike zone boundaries and the
          change in run expectancy.
