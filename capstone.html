        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to expand on the research and list of
          failure modes for artificial intelligence and machine learning
          provided by the US Army DEVCOM Data and Analysis Center which was
          accomplished by analyzing federated learning and its failure modes to
          the project. Federated learning is a novel way of training an
          artificial intelligence or machine learning model using multiple
          agents. The idea is to train a central algorithm or model using the
          outputs of running this model on several different agents and data
          sets. The implementation and use of this style of training opens up
          new possibilities of security risks and failures especially with the
          impacting the trained model, while allowing a model to be trained on a
          wide variety of data in a shorter amount of time.
