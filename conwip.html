          This project showcases the ability to gain valuable insights on
          manufacturing processes given little information. The system is
          multi-product and has 3 workstations which products are developed.
          CONWIP refers to the fact that the system will always have the same
          number of products in the system (CONstant Work-In-Progress)

        <p>The figure below shows the pathing the 2 products must take.</p>

          Using an approximation algorithm for marie's mean value algorithm, do
          12 iterations on the two product problem with CONSTANT WIP Limits of
          (6, 10). The networks above are the routings for the two products. The
          mean service time (in hours) for these two products are:

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this exercise/project is to demonstrate how one is able
          to calculate workstation and factory performance measures using
          limited information. In this case, the only values we are working with
          are the service times for each product on each workstation and the
          route each product takes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The approximation for marie's mean value algorithm is extremely useful
          for situations where there are multiple products which have to take
          different paths. Using just Marie's Mean Value algorithm would result
          in too many calculations.

        <p>
          Taking the information from the workstation flow diagrams, we can
          create a p-matrix for both products. Then using this, a vector for
          relative flow rates can be found using Property 8.1 (Curry). Below is
          the diagram and formula for relative flow:

        <p>
          Now all of the hand calculation is done and a code was written to
          calculate each iteration of the approximation algorithm. An
          explanation for the steps needed to complete the technique can be
          found in Chapter 8 of Curry's textbook. This technique converges on a
          value if enough iterations are performed and provides great accuracy.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          After running the python script, the workstation measures and total
          system measures are calculated. The cycle time is the amount of time a
          product takes to pass throuh the workstation/system. The throughput is
          the rate at which the products are pulled through the system. WIP is
          constant (hence the name CONWIP) for the system however the WIP at
          each workstation can still be calculated. The utilization is the
          proportion of time a workstation spends busy.
